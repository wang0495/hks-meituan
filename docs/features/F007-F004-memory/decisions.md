# Decisions Log

Record technical decisions and their rationale.
If unmanaged docs artifacts exist outside the canonical docs surface (for example `docs/plans/*` or `docs/superpowers/*`), capture the accepted trade-offs and rationale here so the active feature keeps its own decision trail.

> ADR (Architecture Decision Record) captures important technical or architectural choices made during implementation.
> Write ADRs so the team can trace why a choice was made and revisit trade-offs later.

> Format: `D007: F004-memory design decision (2026-05-09)`

Recording principles:

- Prefer `npx lee-spec-kit decision add <feature-ref> --title "..." --context "..." --decision "..." --rationale "..." --evidence "..."` when creating a new ADR.
- Every ADR must capture both **Decision (what was chosen)** and **Trace (how it was evaluated and validated)**.
- Use fixed timing checkpoints:
  - Task start (`[TODO] -> [DOING]`): add 1-3 lines for `Context/Constraints` and `Trace (initial hypothesis)`
  - Right before task done (`[DOING] -> [DONE]`): finalize `Options/Decision/Rationale` and enrich `Trace`
  - After PR merge: append 1-2 lines in `Trace (post-merge check)` with actual outcome/impact
- Every ADR must include at least one **Evidence link** (commit, PR, or test/log evidence).
